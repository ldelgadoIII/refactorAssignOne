# Code Refactor Assign. One

## Summary of Assignment

The goal of this assignment was to implement accessibility to websites. Semantic code was used in plce of div tags in order to provide users and fellow coding collaborators easier readability to the published website and the code itself. Using semantic code creates a clear division of the page and defines what should be expected when viewing a certain portion of the website or coding file. The css file was also reorganized to follow the flow of the webpage. Comments were also added to show which code will style a given section. In the event that images fail to load onto a page, "alt" tags have been inclded with description of the relavant image. Lastly, a title has been added to allow viewers to immediately grasp an idea of the page they are viewing.
